# Project Log — <Project Name>

## 1. Problem / Opportunity
**What problem am I solving?**  
- Who is the user?
- What job are they trying to get done?
- Why is this problem worth solving?

**Context**
- Is this a real-world use case, a learning exercise, or both?
- Where would this live in a real product?

---

## 2. Product Hypothesis
**My hypothesis**
- If we build <X>, users will be able to <Y>, resulting in <Z>.

**Success signals**
- What would “working” look like?
- What would make this worth shipping?

---

## 3. Approach & Architecture
**High-level approach**
- How did I decide to solve this?
- What alternatives did I consider (and reject)?

**Architecture overview**
- Inputs (data, triggers, users)
- Core logic (LLM, agent, RAG, rules)
- Tools & integrations
- Outputs

(Optional: add a simple diagram or bullet flow)

---

## 4. AI Design Decisions (Important)
**Models used**
- Which model(s) and why?
- Cloud vs local?
- Trade-offs (cost, latency, control, quality)

**Prompting / Agent logic**
- Prompt strategy (system vs user prompts)
- Tool calling / function calling decisions
- Agent vs workflow decision

**RAG (if applicable)**
- Data source(s)
- Chunking strategy
- Retrieval method
- Known limitations

---

## 5. Implementation Notes
**What I actually built**
- Key components
- Workflow steps
- Non-obvious implementation details

**What went wrong**
- Bugs, dead ends, wrong assumptions
- How I debugged or adjusted

---

## 6. Outcome & Learnings
**What worked well**
- Technical
- Product-wise

**What didn’t**
- What I would not repeat

**Key learnings**
- One technical insight
- One product insight

---

## 7. If This Were Production…
**What I would improve next**
- Reliability
- UX
- Safety / guardrails
- Cost / performance

**Risks & considerations**
- Hallucinations
- Data privacy
- Edge cases
- Maintenance concerns

---

## 8. Artifacts
- GitHub repo / folder:
- Demo video (Loom / YouTube):
- Screenshots:
- Related Airtable task(s):

---

## 9. Portfolio Readiness
- [ ] Clear user problem
- [ ] Explainable AI decisions
- [ ] Working demo
- [ ] Honest trade-offs documented

**Would I show this to a recruiter today? Why / why not?**
